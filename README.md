# orgs-data

The main goal of this repository is to facilitate bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure in the context of (1) leaked secrets (e.g. with [trufflesecurity/trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog)) and (2) GitHub Actions workflow vulnerabilities (e.g. with [nikitastupin/pwnhub](https://github.com/nikitastupin/pwnhub)) but also (3) to help with reconnaissance (e.g. gathering domains and parameter names from organization's repositories). Having said that, feel free to find and share other ways to use this repository!

## Contributing

> It is challenging to keep the database like this up-to-date. However, when each of us contributes a bit it becomes much easier and benefits everyone!

We are open to contributions and appreciate your willingness to help! In particular, we are happy when you share missing (1) GitHub organizations and (2) BBPs/VDPs. See the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions.
